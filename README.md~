# AutoFeederForContinuousDeployment-
This script is part of a larger setup that automatically picks builds from common storage and matches them with their respective supporting components ie servers etc . This is meant to feeding build to buildbot or any other CI ops .  This implements a long pollers that can be natively daemonized or controlled using Supervisor . We use Simpleflock  to implement a shared persistent pickle .
